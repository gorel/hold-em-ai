This is a poker playing AI I designed to make decisions for Texas Hold 'Em games.

It could potentially be repurposed for any poker game, though.

There is also a GUI made as a Shoes app, but it is not polished -- I made it just to be easier for a user to input their data and find out what decision they should make.

After the AI class is some short test code I used to ensure everything was working correctly.

The test code creates a new AI that simulates 2500 games for every decision it makes.

For the simulations, the AI will always be facing three opponents with pot odds of (blind = 50, call = 50, current pot = 150)

The test code will perform 100 trials like so:
1)  Two random cards are chosen -- these are the AI's private cards
2)  The AI sets the pot odds
3)  The timer is started
4)  The AI decides what should be done with its two cards and outputs which cards it had and the decision it reached
5)  The AI ends the round to prepare for the next set of cards
6)  The timer is stopped and the elapsed time is recorded

After the 100 trials are done, the average, minimum, maximum, and total times elapsed will be displayed.
